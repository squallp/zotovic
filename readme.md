# ZotoviÄ‡ setup

First time actually setting up a project using NPM, Gulp and Bower so take it
easy with me on this one.

## Requirements

* NodeJS and NPM
* Gulp
* SASS
* Bower

## Install

* Clone this repo
* Run npm install
* Run bower install

This project is using Browser Sync so you don't have to refresh your Browser
window every time you make a change to some html, js or css files.
Just run gulp watch and voila!

## To do:

* Set font families
* Go through different screen sizes
* Add missing custom icons
